# What is LoaDuck

LoaDuck is a minimalistic bootloader. It has been created for WaxusBS. Can't add anything else at the moment, so... that's it

# How to build:

It is still has static content so... in file main.asm in src/ directory just change last fields which starts with "    " (4 spaces). It can't load you into OS, but it just works as preview prototype at the moment. It doesn't even read partition systems types at the moment. After changing "boot options" (called as message, msg, msg_two and msg_three) you can write make in your terminal. I mean not in src/ directory, but in the project directory (there is a Makefile there). In the future I'm gonna add new things here, but at the moment I am working on wsh (if you want to know something about it, I can create YouTube channel for this project (I mean not only LoaDuck, but WaxusBS))

# What about old name (Collidie)?

It is not collidie anymore. Now it is just LoaDuck. It is even more simple, than Collidie. Previous name (Collidie) will be used for another one application (not sure for which, but sure that it will be used)

Btw, it used to be called Collidie (it is still called Collidie on my PC and laptop)
